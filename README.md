Welcome to StarComâ€™s Cold Email Generator Tool! ðŸŽ¯

This repository hosts a tool that automates cold email generation, allowing service companies to reach out to potential clients efficiently by leveraging Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit.

Problem Statement
Companies like Nike invest significant time and resources in hiring, onboarding, and training engineers, especially in high-demand fields like Machine Learning. StarCom, a software development company, can simplify this process by providing dedicated engineers who are ready to integrate into teams, helping businesses save on recruitment time and costs.

Our tool enables Business Development Executives, like Astika at StarCom, to extract job listings from a company's careers page and automatically generate personalized cold emails offering tailored services.
